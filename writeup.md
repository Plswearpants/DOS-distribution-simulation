key question to evaluate: 

DOS(E) proportional to the inverse of gradient of E with respect to K. vs the method used in the tomography paper.

Steps: 
1. gather a Wannier model for a certain system, prefered to be studied by STM. 
2. certain system: 3D electronic structure, meaning has a Kz dispersion.
3. I decided on MoS2/ LiFeAs 

Intro and motivation: 

QPI is about band scattering, the more complex the band structure is, the more difficult is it to disentangle information from a QPI measurement. And it is very important to have a focus system where we can focus on features that dominates the QPI measurements and tries to tie that to certain part of the band structure. One way to achieve such a focus is to look at the density of state distribution at a certain energy cut, a famous one is the Octet model for cuprate, in particular the BSCCO, where Hoffman analyzed the CEC of BSCCO and successfully mapped points at different energy levels that dominates the scattering singals that she observe in QPI. In systems where the electronic structures have more kz dispersion,  C. A. Marques etal showed that different Kz slices are responsible for dominating scattering signals at different energy levels. And they developed a formalism where they can predict the dominating Kz slice by looking at the curvature of the fermi surface. 
However, it is not clear where the formalism C. A. Marques etal developed originates. Is the curvature of the fermi surface related to the DOS concentration? Or is it rooted from a different origin that affect the scattering process? 

I therefore perform both methods onto a simple 2 Band TB model that has a Kz dispersion, with the hope to correlate these 2 methods, and illustrate ways we can use to map the dominating features on QPI signals to a specific part of the 3D band structure.
